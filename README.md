Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Overview

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a powerful technique used for both dimensionality reduction and classification. In this set of exercises, we will explore how LDA can be applied to different datasets to achieve two main goals: reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much class-discriminative information as possible, and classifying data into distinct categories.

### Lab Exercise 1: LDA for Dimensionality Reduction

#### Objective:
The aim of this exercise is to understand the principles behind LDA and apply it to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze the data in lower dimensions.

#### Theory:
LDA is a supervised method used to project data onto a lower-dimensional space, optimizing the separation between different classes. Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is unsupervised and focuses on maximizing variance, LDA seeks to maximize the separation between multiple classes by minimizing intra-class variance and maximizing inter-class variance.

In this exercise, we will:
1. **Standardize** the Iris dataset, ensuring that all features have the same scale (mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).
2. **Apply LDA** to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset from 4 features to 2.
3. **Visualize** the transformed data to see how well the LDA separates the three Iris classes.

#### Instructions:
1. **Load the Dataset**: Use the Iris dataset, which has 4 features and 3 classes.
2. **Standardization**: Standardize the data for better performance in LDA.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction with LDA**: Reduce the dataset to 2 dimensions.
4. **Comparison with PCA**: Compare the 2D projection from LDA with PCA, and observe which method gives better class separation.

#### Expected Outcome:
LDA should provide a clear separation between the different classes in the Iris dataset, often more effectively than PCA, since LDA uses class labels to optimize the transformation.

### Lab Exercise 2: LDA for Classification

#### Objective:
In this exercise, we will explore LDA as a classifier by applying it to a multi-class classification problem. The goal is to train an LDA model to classify different types of wine and compare its performance with a logistic regression model.

#### Theory:
LDA can also be used for classification tasks. It assumes that each class follows a Gaussian distribution and that the covariance across classes is similar. By estimating the parameters of these distributions, LDA finds the linear boundaries that separate the classes. Once trained, it can assign new data points to one of the predefined classes.

In this exercise, we will:
1. **Train** an LDA classifier using the Wine dataset.
2. **Evaluate** its performance by measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
3. **Compare** the performance with a logistic regression model to see which method performs better in terms of classification.
4. (Optional) **Visualize** the decision boundaries in 2D space to gain a deeper understanding of how LDA and logistic regression separate the classes.

#### Instructions:
1. **Load the Dataset**: Use the Wine dataset, which contains 13 features and 3 classes.
2. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into 70% training and 30% testing.
3. **Train the LDA Classifier**: Fit an LDA model to the training data and predict the labels for the test set.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for the LDA model.
5. **Compare with Logistic Regression**: Train a logistic regression model on the same dataset and compare its performance with the LDA model.

#### Expected Outcome:
LDA and logistic regression are both linear classifiers, but LDA might outperform logistic regression in cases where the classes are well separated. Evaluating both methods will help understand their differences in handling the data.

### Summary

These exercises highlight two important applications of LDA:
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: LDA projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space, focusing on maximizing class separation.
2. **Classification**: LDA can classify new data points into predefined categories by finding linear boundaries based on Gaussian assumptions.
